# Contributing

We appreciate contributions of any kind and acknowledge them on our 
[README][readme]. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our 
[code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## How Can You Contribute?

### Find a bug? See room for improvement?

Add an issue. We'll review it, add labels and reply within a few days.

### Want to work on an issue?

Comment on the issue that you'd like to work on it and we'll assign it to you. 
If the issue is assigned to someone else already, you might want to ask the 
contributor if they'd like some help.

### Documentation/etc need updating?

Go right ahead! Just submit a pull request when you're done.

## Pull Requests

First, make sure you've forked the repository. Push to your fork and 
[submit a pull request](https://github.com/michaeljolley/vscode-vs-outlining/compare/) 
against the `main` branch.

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on pull requests
within three days (and, typically, one day). We may suggest some changes or 
improvements or alternatives.

> If you've made code changes, be sure to update or add any necessary tests. Also,
> make sure that all tests pass.

### Code Reviews
